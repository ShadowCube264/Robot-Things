# Robot-Things

## Branches

The simulator is stupid, and only runs code in a `robot.py` file, so it's probably easier to work on different code in different Git branches for now.

This `main` branch only contains the sample code from the simulator, while the `basic-test` branch has a simple example of working with the camera and recognising markers.

You can make this work with the simulator by opening the `zone_0` folder, deleting any files already inside, and running `git clone https://github.com/ShadowCube264/Robot-Things.git .` (Make sure to include the full stop)
