# Robot-Things

## Branches

The simulator is stupid, and only runs code in a `robot.py` file, so it's probably easier to work on different code in different Git branches for now.

This `main` branch only contains the sample code from the simulator, while the `basic-test` branch has a simple example of working with the camera and recognising markers.
